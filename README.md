# Tech_Website
Created my first fully functioning website on a tech related business.

Hi developers, if you want to check my website, please download this folders/files and save it to xampp/htdocs/your_foldername/ and please turn on your apache live server then go to your browser and just type localhost/your_foldername.
Although you can also make it possible via vscode or other frame works.
